This was a project on Time Frequency Analysis of musical instruments carried out as part of my master in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London. Question 1 in the report examines the paper within, "paper.pdf". This paper describes three core concepts for time and frequency analysis: Fourier spectra, spectograms and scalograms. Question 2 and 3 in the report then focus on using these methods to analyse the data.wav file.

Contents: 
data.wav: Sound excerpt time frequency analysis to be carried out on.
report.pdf: Written report corresponding to questions given around time frequency analysis.
paper.pdf: Paper we are quizzed on for Question 1 of the written report.
project.py: Python script which carries out analysis and outputs figures and plots used in written report.
